# The Dut Programming Language

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dut-lang/dut.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dut-lang/dut)

Dut is a high level imperative, **object-oriented** programming language,
designed to be a light-weight scripting language that fits in the size, memory
bandwidth, and real-time requirements of applications.

## Problem (inspiration)

We wrote some shell script software (even though not the best language,
you realize that working with array), alternative to those who like
shell script

*The project has been compiled and run on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X*

## Install

	git clone git@github.com:dut-lang/dut.git
	cd dut
	make
	src/dut/dut
